# Machine_learning_course

This repository contains coding projects for a machine learning course I took at my university. The class is very theory-heavy, so most of the work in the course involved doing math on paper. Additionally, since the course was theory-focused, most of the coding portions involved using NumPy to implement machine learning algorithms, in order to develop an intuition for how the algorithms work. The project on convolutional neural networks and transformers was one that used PyTorch.
