# Machine_learning_course

This repository contains coding assignments for CS 189: Introduction to Machine Learning at Berkeley. The class is very theory-heavy, so most of the assignments were doing math on paper. Additionally, since the class was theory-focused, most of the coding portions involved using NumPy to implement machine learning algorithms, in order to develop an intuition for how the algorithms work. The assignment on convolutional neural networks and transformers was the only one that used PyTorch.
